Python Login System using a Python Hashing library and SQLite3 for connecting and using databases

Libraries used:
- tkinter
- sqlite3
- hashlib

Built for fun while having some spare time
Some known issues/future improvements:
  - Haven't figured out comparing two hashes for making sure its the correct password when logging in yet
  - Improving design and formatting due to it being boring and bland

Feel Free to use this code for your own projects, it's not perfect and can always be improved!
